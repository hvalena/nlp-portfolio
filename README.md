# nlp-portfolio
This repository is Hannah Valena's portfolio for CS 4395.001: Human Language Technologies, taken in Fall 2022 with Dr. Karen Mazidi.

## üå± Assignment 0: Getting Started
You can find an [Overview of NLP here](Overview-Of-NLP.pdf)! 

## üìù Assignment 1: Text Processing with Python
### Program overview
This program reads and processes a csv file of employee data. It makes the information more standardized by using
some basic regex expressions and text processing.  
  
You can find the [assignment description here](Homework1/portfolio-component-1-instructions.pdf), the
[Homework 1 folder here](Homework1), and the [Homework 1 python script here](Homework1/homework1-hcv180000.py).
### How to run the program
You can run this program either from a terminal or in an IDE, like PyCharm:
#### Running from the terminal
1. Navigate to the directory where this program is stored
2. Run: `$ python3 homework1-hcv180000.py data/data.csv`  

#### Running from an IDE (PyCharm)
1. Open the directory where this program is stored in your IDE
2. Add a new run/debug configuration with the path to [homework1-hcv180000.py](Homework1/homework1-hcv180000.py) as 
the script path and [data/data.csv](Homework1/data/data.csv) as a parameter
3. Select this newly created run configuration and run the program  

### Strengths & weaknesses of Python for text processing
Python's NLTK provides many libraries that have many text processing functionalities, which makes Python a good choice
of language for NLP. Python syntax is also very similar to the English language, and it almost feels like writing
pseudocode. This makes Python pretty intuitive to learn and use. I haven't noticed any weaknesses yet for text 
processing with Python, but I know that Python's dynamic typing can lead to slower performance times than other
languages.  

### What I learned in this assignment
In this assignment, I learned how to use sysarg, open/read files regardless of OS, write classes, and use regex in
Python. I also learned that pickle files make it easier to save data structures to a file.  
  
## üöÄ Assignment 2: Exploring NLTK
This assignment explores Python's Natural Language Toolkit using Google Colab Notebook.  
  
You can find the [assignment description here](Homework2/portfolio-component2-instructions.pdf), the [Homework 2 folder here](Homework2), and the [Homework 2 Google Colab notebook here](Homework2/cs4395_001_assignment2_hcv180000.ipynb).
