### Relationship between AI and NLP
Artificial intelligence (AI) describes how computers simulate human intelligence by performing human-like actions and problem-solving processes. NLP branches from AI by focusing specifically on human language and communication.

### Examples of modern NLP applications

- Speech to text, eg "Hey Alexa", "Hey Siri", "OK Google"
- Spell check
- Email filters and spam email identification
- Predictive text
- Search results

### The 3 main approaches to NLP
#### Approach 1: Rules-based
The rules-based approach is the oldest approach to NLP. This approach is exactly as it sounds - it is based on grammar and syntax rules, which often use regular expressions to generate or interpret sentences. Even if a list of exceptions are provided with the rules, this approach is problematic because of the complexity and nuances of human language.  
Some examples are of rules-based approaches:
- Eliza, the computer chatbot that doubles as a "therapist": Eliza uses regular expressions (regex) and code to emulate chatting to a therapist.
